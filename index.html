                    <h2><span><i class="fa-brands fa-pagelines"></i></span>Herbal tea that calm you down</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span>Lavender</span><br>Lavender is a natural sedative, helping to slow our racing thoughts and relax our bodies. As well as giving us a more restful night’s sleep lavender’s calming effects can also help to reduce anxiety while we’re awake, giving us some much-needed calm</li>
                        <li><span>Passionflower</span><br>Passionflower contains significant amounts of the flavonoid apigenin, making this herb a natural alternative to antidepressants for treating anxiety and stress. Its mild taste means it can easily be added to any herbal tea blend to help us find peace and calm.</li>
                        <li><span>Ashwagandha</span><br>Ashwaghandha has been used for centuries in India as a traditional remedy for anxiety and stress. As well as calming our minds, ashwagandha is known for giving us a boost of energy and mental clarity</li>
                        <li><span>Lemon Balm</span><br>A member of the mint family, lemon balm has a soothing citrus and mint taste.Lemon balm’s calming properties appear to come from its ability to stimulate the production of GABA, a neurotransmitter found in our brains. Low levels of this neurotransmitter are associated with anxiety and low mood, so drinking lemon balm tea regularly might help to boost your mood and soothe your stress.</li>
                    </ul>
                 </div>

                    <h2><span><i class="fa-brands fa-envira"></i></span>Herbal tea which give you energy</h2>
                    <ul>
                       <li><span>Green Tea</span><br>For those who can’t do without their daily dose of caffeine, green tea is a great choice. It contains caffeine, which means it gives you all those associated benefits – increased energy, focus, and alertness. However, it also contains L-theanine, a compound that helps to balance out the caffeine by making you feel calmer and less stressed.</li>
                        <li><span>Ginseng</span><br>In Traditional Chinese Medicine, ginseng is used as an all-round tonic and is said to bring vitality and mental clarity. Scientific studies support these claims – ginseng helps to reduce fatigue and boost both physical and mental energy.</li>
                        <li><span>Astragalus</span><br>Like ginseng, astragalus is used in Traditional Chinese Medicine to treat tiredness and fatigue. In Chinese, this herb is known as huang qi, which translates as ‘yellow life energy’. It’s an adaptogen, like many of the herbs on this list, helping to combat stress at the same time as raising your energy levels.</li>
                        <li><span>Guarana</span><br>For a quick burst of energy, guarana is definitely your friend. This herb is native to South America and is packed full of caffeine, giving you plenty of energy when you most need it. Indeed, guarana has a higher caffeine content than coffee, so you’ll only need a small amount of this herb to feel the effects.</li>
